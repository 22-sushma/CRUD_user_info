📘 README: User Management API
🛠 Overview
This project is a simple Express.js router module that provides a RESTful API for managing user data. It supports basic CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete — using an in-memory array.
🚀 Features
- GET / → Retrieve all users
- GET /:email → Retrieve a user by email
- POST / → Add a new user via query parameters
- PUT /:email → Update user details by email
- DELETE /:email → Delete a user by email
 Installation
npm install express

⚠️ Notes
- Data is stored in-memory; restarting the server will reset the user list.
- Query parameters are used for POST and PUT — consider switching to req.body for production use.

📤 Export
This router is exported using:
module.exports = router;



You can import and use it in your main server file like:
const userRouter = require('./src/component/userRouter');
app.use('/users', userRouter);
